# Pulsar Star Detection

**Description:** In a group of 3, we coded a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify lung nodules into either normal, benign, or malignant at UC Santa Barbara Summer Research Academies with 99%+ accuracy. 

**Motivation:**
I coded this model as a fun, personal project driven by my recent interest in space and star exploration. Pulsar stars are difficult to detect even with professional instruments, but they emit radio waves that interfere with our signals on Earth. As a result, we can track and detect these stars by training a machine learning model with a dataset of these interference singals, which is what I did in this project. 

**Technologies:**
Python (PyTorch)
